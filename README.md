# 42-gnl-libft-ft_printf

## Overview

This project is a collection of three essential components often required in 42 School projects: `get_next_line` (gnl), `libft`, and `ft_printf`. Each of these components serves a specific purpose and can be used individually or together in larger projects.

### Components

1. **libft:**
   - `libft` is a custom C library that provides a set of common functions for string manipulation, memory management, linked lists, and more. This library is meant to be a replacement for the standard C library functions, with a focus on efficiency and 42 School guidelines.

2. **ft_printf:**
   - `ft_printf` is a custom implementation of the printf function. It allows formatted output to be displayed on the console, offering a wide range of formatting options similar to the standard printf in C.

3. **get_next_line (gnl):**
   - `get_next_line` is a function designed to read a line from a file descriptor. It is particularly useful when dealing with input streams that may not fit into fixed-size buffers.

## Usage

### get_next_line (gnl)

To use `get_next_line` in your project, follow these steps:

```c

//modify names in the super_header.h as you need.

#include "super_header.h"

int main(void)
{
   //your code
   return (0);
}
```

### Installation

To use these components in your project, simply copy the relevant files into your project directory and include the corresponding header files in your source code. Change as you need.
